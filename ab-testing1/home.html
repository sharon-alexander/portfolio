    <p>
      This morning, as I was waiting for my coffee to brew, I opened up instagram and noticed that the interface was
      different. New features, such as instagram shop,
      were added and the "search" and "activity" icons were moved to the top of the page. I struggled to find the search
      icon
      for like, 10 seconds! Annoying. When my roommate woke up,
      I expressed my frustration and she told me that her interface hadn't changed yet. This, my friends, is a classic
      example of A/B testing. <br> <br>

      <b> A/B testing involves showing two different versions of a webpage to webpage visitors and then comparing the
        two to see which performs better. </b> A version's performance
      can be evaluated using a number of different metrics, such as measuring the time taken to complete a task. <br>
      <br>

      For this project, I created two versions of an online cactus shop. In this article, I'm going to walk you through
      the two versions I made, how I collected user data, and how I
      evaluated their performance based on two metrics: <b> time to completion</b> and <b> return rate </b>(explained
      below). <br> <br> Letâ€™s get started!
    </p>

  </div>

  <!-- website versions -->
  <div class="subtitle" id="website-versions">
    website versions
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The two versions of my website can be viewed <a href="https://guarded-scrubland-58294.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
      (the link will randomly
      display either version A or B).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="heading"><b>version A </b> </div>
  <div class="image">
    <img src="versionA.png" alt="version A" width="1000">
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph"> Notice how in version A, the "Add To Cart", button is on the right of the image. </div>


  <div class="heading"> <b> version B</b></div>

  <div class="image">
    <img src="versionB.png" alt="version B" width="1000">
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph"> Notice how in version B, the "Add To Cart", button is below the image. </div>

  <!-- hypothesis -->
  <div class="subtitle" id="hypotheses">
    hypotheses
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      Once I created version A and version B of the website, I made a series of hypotheses on how the two versions would
      perform.
      Regardless of which version a user gets, their task was to <b>fill their cart with at least $150 of
        cacti. </b> The performance of each version was measured using two metrics:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="summary">
    <ul>
      <li> <b> time to completion:</b> the time it takes to fill a cart with at least $150 of cacti)</li>
      <li><b> return rate: </b>the number of times a user returned to the browsing page from the checkout page</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="heading"><b>time to completion hypothesis</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p><b>Null:
      </b>the time to completion of version A will <b>be equal </b>to that of version B.
      <br> <br>
      <b>Alternative:</b> The time to completion of version B will be <b>lower </b>than that of version A because
      version
      B has a
      clearer layout.
      Since it is clearer, the user will complete the task faster.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="heading"><b>return rate hypothesis</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><b>
      <p>Null:
    </b>the return rate of version A will <b>be equal </b>to that of version B.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Alternative:</b> The return rate of version A will <b>not be equal </b>to the return rate of version B because
    version B has a
    clearer layout.
    Since the task is to add cacti to a cart, one could argue that you don't want the user to be returning to the browse
    page. You want the user to fill their cart with at least $150 of cacti and that's it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- data collection -->
  <div class="subtitle" id="data-collection">
    data collection
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>In order to collect user data, I sent out my website link to friends and peers in my UI/UX class at Brown
      University. As mentioned earlier, the link
      randomly displays either version A or B. Every time a user would carry out the task, I received a data log which
      included timestamps of when the user loaded the webpage, clicked
      on any "Add To Cart" button, and whether the user clicked on "CART" at any point to navigate to the checkout
      page.<br> <br>
      Once I had the data logs from all the users, I transferred the data
      to a CSV file for data cleaning. This involved removing outliers and removing logs from users who just navigated
      to my webpage but didn't do anything.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- data analysis + conclusions -->
  <div class="subtitle" id="data-analysis-conclusions">
    data analysis + conclusions
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      Once the data was cleaned, I was able to calculate time to completion by subtracting the timestamp of the initial
      page load time from the timestamp of the last action the user performed.
      I measured return rate by checking whether each user <i> returned </i> to the browsing after having gone to the
      checkout page. Finally, I was ready to run statistical tests on the data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="heading"><b>time to completion: t-test</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> I calculated the average time to completion for all the version A users and then all the version B users. In
      order to see whether
      there was a statistically significant difference between the two means, I conducted a t-test. However, in order to
      draw conclusions from the t-test,
      the p-value must be below 0.05. Since the p-value obtained from my t-test was 0.362, the difference between the
      time to completion of version A and that
      of version B is <b>not statistically significant.</b> Therefore, we must <b>fail to reject the null hypothesis
      </b>, which was that the time to completion of version A will be equal to that of version B.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="heading"><b>return rate: chi-squared test</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> Since return rate is categorical data (i.e. a user either returned or didn't), I conducted a chi-squared test to
      compare the percentage of users who returned in version A to the percentage of users
      who returned in version B. Once again, since the p-value of the test was 0.445 (which is greater than 0.05), the
      difference between the return rate of version A and that of B is <b> not statistically significant.</b>
      Therefore, we must <b> fail to reject the null hypothesis</b>, which was that the return rate of version A will be
      equal to that of version B.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Unfortunately, since both the t-test and chi-squared test were not statistically significant, I could not
        draw any conclusions on how the design differences between version A and version B affected each version's
        performance. </li>
      <li> I think the major limitation in this study was the small sample size of users and the fact that all of the
        participating users were Brown students. In order to obtain more accurate results,
        I would conduct the same test on a larger group of users across different demographics (e.g. different age
        groups, occupations etc.) </li>
