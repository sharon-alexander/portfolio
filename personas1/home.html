    <p>Let’s face it - we all hate long lines. Whether you have a million things to do or are on vacation,
      nobody wants to wait twenty minutes to buy a bottle of shampoo. This is how self checkout systems gained
      momentum in recent years. Self checkout allow customers to quickly scan and purchase their items instead
      of paying at a traditional staffed counter. Retailers, such as CVS, have implemented self checkout counters
      across their many locations in order to increase checkout efficiency. But the question is, do self-checkout
      counters actually improve customers’ shopping experience? <br> <br>Let’s find out...

    observations + interviews
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    For my research, I observed three users use CVS’s self checkout system and then interviewed them about their
    experience.
    When I made these observations, the CVS was relatively empty and there was no line for the self checkout or the
    staffed
    checkout. The following is a summary of my observations about the users’ actions and any struggles or difficulties
    that they encountered:
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <ul>
      <li>One user pressed on all of the buttons without hesitation, before the voice prompt would finish its sentence.
      </li>
      <li>One user waited until after the voice prompts to perform an action. </li>
      <li>One user had to insert her credit card three times until the payment worked. The user mentioned that she was
        frustrated by this. </li>
      <li>One user was confused by where the bagging area was when the voice prompted him to place his items in the
        bagging area. </li>
      <li>While paying, users are prompted by a big block of text asking if they would like to round up their change to
        support a food bank.
        All of the users I observed quickly clicked “no”. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    After observing the users, I interviewed them about their experience. Here are a sample of questions from the
    interview:
  </div>

  <div class="questions">
    <ol>
      <li>Do you have a preference between self-checkout counters or staffed checkout counters?</li>
      <li>Do you think the number of items you purchase impact your decision on whether to self checkout?</li>
      <li>What was your first reaction to the self-checkout interface?</li>
      <li>Were you able to self-checkout in your first language today?</li>
      <li>Have you encountered a technical glitch with this interface before? If so, do you remember what it was?</li>
      <li>Did you find the text on the screen easy to read?</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you find the voice prompt with 1 being not helpful at all and 5 being
        very helpful.</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how annoying did you find the voice prompt with 1 being very annoying and 5 being not
        annoying at all.</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your experience with the machine with 1 being very bad and 5 being
        very good?</li>
      <li>Would you use the self-checkout counter again?</li>
