    <p>Let’s face it - we all hate long lines. Whether you have a million things to do or are on vacation,
      nobody wants to wait twenty minutes to buy a bottle of shampoo. This is how self checkout systems gained
      momentum in recent years. Self checkout allow customers to quickly scan and purchase their items instead
      of paying at a traditional staffed counter. Retailers, such as CVS, have implemented self checkout counters
      across their many locations in order to increase checkout efficiency. But the question is, do self-checkout
      counters actually improve customers’ shopping experience? <br> <br>Let’s find out...

    observations + interviews
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    For my research, I observed three users use CVS’s self checkout system and then interviewed them about their
    experience.
    When I made these observations, the CVS was relatively empty and there was no line for the self checkout or the
    staffed
    checkout. The following is a summary of my observations about the users’ actions and any struggles or difficulties
    that they encountered:
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <ul>
      <li>One user pressed on all of the buttons without hesitation, before the voice prompt would finish its sentence.
      </li>
      <li>One user waited until after the voice prompts to perform an action. </li>
      <li>One user had to insert her credit card three times until the payment worked. The user mentioned that she was
        frustrated by this. </li>
      <li>One user was confused by where the bagging area was when the voice prompted him to place his items in the
        bagging area. </li>
      <li>While paying, users are prompted by a big block of text asking if they would like to round up their change to
        support a food bank.
        All of the users I observed quickly clicked “no”. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    After observing the users, I interviewed them about their experience. Here are a sample of questions from the
    interview:
  </div>

  <div class="questions">
    <ol>
      <li>Do you have a preference between self-checkout counters or staffed checkout counters?</li>
      <li>Do you think the number of items you purchase impact your decision on whether to self checkout?</li>
      <li>What was your first reaction to the self-checkout interface?</li>
      <li>Were you able to self-checkout in your first language today?</li>
      <li>Have you encountered a technical glitch with this interface before? If so, do you remember what it was?</li>
      <li>Did you find the text on the screen easy to read?</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how helpful did you find the voice prompt with 1 being not helpful at all and 5 being
        very helpful.</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how annoying did you find the voice prompt with 1 being very annoying and 5 being not
        annoying at all.</li>
      <li>On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your experience with the machine with 1 being very bad and 5 being
        very good?</li>
      <li>Would you use the self-checkout counter again?</li>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> This project taught me how to design interviews and write questions in way that reduces bias and gets the most
      accurate and honest responses out of interviewees.
      For example, asking similar questions in different ways might cause interviewees to mention something that they
      had previously left out. I also learned about how creating personas can help with
      product development by shedding light on user behavior. Moreover, this project helped me understand how
      storyboarding (and storytelling in general) can help designers empathize with users and better understand what
      problems a product should be trying to solve. </p>
