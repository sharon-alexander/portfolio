    <p> You just finished making dinner after a long day at work and now it's time to put the baby to sleep. What
      better way than with a playlist of all of your baby's favorite lullabies?
      Or maybe it's your child's birthday party and you don't know what type of music to play. No worries - check out
      the most liked albums on Baby Bops to see which songs kids like these days.
      <br><br>
      During one of our studios for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experiences, my partner and I created a
      prototype of a spotify for babies application. I thought that turning this prototype into an application would
      be a fun way to learn React.

    </p>

  <div class="subtitle" id="app">my application - baby bops </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> My application, Baby Bops, is a music streaming app specifically designed for babies and young children. Since
      babies wouldn't be directly interacting with the application, but rather parents, I tried to make the interface
      both parent and child-friendly. My application displays 12 different albums and for each one, you can see how many
      likes it has, how many songs are in the album, and a button which allows you to add the album to your playlist.
      Below is a screenshot of the app in desktop view and mobile view.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="image"><img src="babybops.png" width="760px" style="margin: 2%"><img src="mobile.png" width="200px"
      style="margin: 2%"></div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> Users can also filter albums by genre (lullabies or movie soundtracks) or by mood (energetic, sleepy, or
      sing-along). So if it's naptime,
      users can conveniently filter the albums so that only lullabies are displayed. If your child had too much candy
      and is jumping all over the place, you can choose to only see albums with energetic tunes.
      The app also has a sorting functionality which allows the user to sort the albums by how many likes they have. So
      if you're not sure what type of music kids like these days,
      you can easily sort the albums by most to least likes and see which ones are the most popular. Lastly, once you
      add albums to your playlist,
      it displays how many songs are in your playlist and also allows you to remove albums if you wish to.

      <br> <br> Here is the <a href="https://vast-oasis-46086.herokuapp.com/"> link</a> to try it yourself &hearts;<br>

  <div class="paragraph">
    As I mentioned earlier, I aimed to make Baby Bop's interface easily usable by both parents and young children. I
    used Nielsen's principles for design and other principles we discussed in class to help me achieve this:
  </div>
  <div class="summary">
    <ul>
      <li><b> accessibility:</b> the app is responsive in order to make it acecssible on different devices
      </li>
      <li><b>help + documenation:</b> the "add your favorite albums to your playlist!" subheading instructs the user on
        how to use the app </li>
      <li><b>help users with errors:</b> if a user tries to add the same album to their playlist more than once, an
        alert appears on the browser </li>
      <li><b>minimal text:</b> in order to appeal to children, I tried to have as little text as possible </li>
      <li><b>familiarity + affordances:</b> I decided to use a heart icon for the number of likes an album has and a
        music library icon for the number of songs in an album since I belive both of these icons are intuitive and
        familiar from other applications</li>
      <li><b>aesthetic:</b> I decided to use bright colors to appeal to children. In addition, I decided to change the
        color of the albums once a user puts them in their playlist to help them easily differentiate between what's in
        their playlist and what isn't </li>
    </ul>
